# triage

A Claude Code skill that triages a batch of raw security-scanner findings:
verifies each is real, collapses duplicates, re-ranks by derived
exploitability, and tags each survivor with a component owner. Turns a raw
dump into a short, ranked, owned list. Pairs with `/thunder-vuln-scan` (which
generates findings) and this repo's `vuln-pipeline` (which generates crash
reports), but also ingests loosely-structured JSON or markdown from other
scanners.

## Requirements

- Claude Code CLI installed and authenticated
- A read-only checkout of the target codebase (verification reads source;
  it does not build or run anything)
- A file or directory of findings to triage

## Installation

Project-scoped (ships with this repo — nothing to do if you cloned it):

```bash
ls .claude/skills/triage/SKILL.md
```

Or user-scoped:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
cp -r .claude/skills/triage ~/.claude/skills/
```

## Usage

From a Claude Code session in the target repo:

```
/thunder-triage path/to/findings.json
```

Interactive mode (the default) opens with a short interview: trust
boundary, threat model, scoring standard (HIGH/MED/LOW vs. CVSS vs. your
org bug-bar), and whether to bias toward precision or recall on split
votes. These answers shape how reachability is judged and how severity is
labeled. If you pick CVSS, have the model emit vectors and compute the
scores with a tool — see
[docs/best-practices.md#cvss](../../../docs/best-practices.md#cvss).
To skip the interview and use precision-biased defaults:

```
/thunder-triage path/to/findings.json --auto
```

Common invocations:

```
/thunder-triage VULN-FINDINGS.json                          # vuln-scan output, repo = cwd
/thunder-triage results/mytarget/2026-04-14/ --repo .       # vuln-pipeline output
/thunder-triage scanner_export/ --votes 5 --repo ~/src/app  # high-stakes batch, 5-vote verify
/thunder-triage backlog.md --auto --votes 1                 # quick first pass on a markdown report
```

## Output

- `./TRIAGE.json` — every input finding, annotated with `verdict`,
  `verify_verdict`, recomputed `severity`, `severity_alignment` vs. the
  scanner's claim, `preconditions`, `vote_breakdown`, `rationale` citing
  file:line evidence, `owner_hint`, and `duplicate_of` where applicable.
  Sorted by what to act on first.
- `./TRIAGE.md` — reviewer-facing report: an "Act on these" section with
  one entry per confirmed finding, then a "Dropped" table explaining every
  rejection.

A `needs_manual_test` verdict means static reasoning hit its limit on that
finding — treat it as a recommendation for a human to build a controlled
proof-of-concept, not as a failure.

## Checkpointing and resume

Per-phase state is written to `./.triage-state/`. If a run is interrupted
(rate limit, context exhaustion, Ctrl-C), re-invoking `/thunder-triage` with the same
arguments resumes from the last completed phase — the interview is not
re-asked and verifiers already tallied are not re-spawned. Pass `--fresh` to
start over. `./.triage-state/` is scratch; add it to `.gitignore`.

## What it does and doesn't do

- **Does:** read source, grep for callers, reason about reachability and
  protections, vote, rank, and route.
- **Does not:** build, run, or test the target; install dependencies;
  reach the network; write proof-of-concept exploits. All conclusions are
  static. This is deliberate — the skill is meant to run in a review box
  alongside a read-only checkout.
